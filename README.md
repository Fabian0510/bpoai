# Speech-to-Text Streamlit Application

## Overview
This project is a Streamlit application that captures audio in real-time, converts speech to text using a websocket-based speech-to-text service, and processes the text through a local language model. It's designed to showcase real-time audio processing and interaction with AI language models.

## Features
- Real-time audio capture using PyAudio.
- Speech-to-text conversion via websockets.
- Integration with local language models for further text processing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pip for Python package installation.

### Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Configuration
Explain any configuration files and environment variables that need to be set up, including the websocket URL for the speech-to-text service and any model-specific settings.
